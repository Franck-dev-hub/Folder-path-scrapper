## 📌 Description
Folder Path Retriever is a simple Python application with a graphical interface (Tkinter) that allows users to:
- Select a folder.
- Optionally include file paths with their extensions.
- Save the retrieved paths to a text file.

## 🚀 Getting Started
### ✅ Prerequisites

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (I advise using `uv`).
3. Install dependencies (you can use `requirements.txt`).

5. Use the graphical interface to configure.

## 💡 Usage
1) Use the "Browse" button to select a folder.
2) Check the "Include files (with extensions)" option if you want to include file paths.
